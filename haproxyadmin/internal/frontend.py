This module provides a class, which is used within haproxyadmin for creating a
object to work with a frontend. This object is associated only with a single
HAProxy process.

        HAProxy assigns unique ids to each object during the startup.
        The id can change when configuration changes, objects order
        is reshuffled or additions/removals take place.
        In those cases the id we store at the instantiation of the object may
        reference to another object or even to non-existent object when
        configuration takes places afterwards.

        The technique we use is quite simple. When an object is created
        we store the name and the id. In order to detect if iid is changed,
        we simply send a request to fetch data only for the given iid and check
        if the current id points to an object of the same type
        (frontend, backend, server) which has the same name.
